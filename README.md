Hi, 
Late is better than never in this case. Thank you for the patience. 
I am open to and would appreciate feedback and/or tips
on areas to impove

For coulmn F (Percent Funded) I didnt know how to change the numbers
to a whole number alone with out there being any symbols.. 
Thats the best I got to my answer.

Pivot Table sheets on excel includes the bar graphs you might have to 
zoom to access them (Im not sure why that is but it was on my end)

Thanks!
